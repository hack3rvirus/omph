# Redesign Catholic Church Website - Progress Tracker

## Overall Plan Summary
Redesign the Our Mother of Perpetual Help Chaplaincy website to be more authentic, beautiful, and comprehensive. Key changes include updated color scheme (deep purple primary, red secondary, gold accent), enhanced interactivity, added associations/societies, populated content across pages, and ensured Catholic authenticity.

## Current Status
- [x] Update color scheme in tailwind.config.js and globals.css (deep purple #581C87, red #B91C1C, gold #FFD700)
- [x] Enhance fonts and add interactive styles (hover effects, animations) in globals.css
- [x] Update navigation and hero section in app/page.tsx for interactivity and animations
- [x] Add more associations (Knights of Columbus, St. Vincent de Paul, Living Rosary Society, Catholic Catechists Association) to app/associations/page.tsx
- [x] Update footer in app/page.tsx to reflect new associations
- [ ] Populate PriestWelcome.tsx with authentic chaplain message
- [ ] Create detailed individual association pages (e.g., app/associations/[id]/page.tsx)
- [ ] Enhance Hero slideshow: Add placeholder images or descriptions for church exterior, OMPH icon, chapel interior, community gatherings
- [ ] Populate other pages: app/about/page.tsx, app/doctrine/page.tsx, app/events/page.tsx, app/contact/page.tsx with authentic Catholic content (history, teachings, events calendar, contact form)
- [ ] Add new sections: Devotions, prayers, patron saint information on home page or dedicated pages
- [ ] Make content authentic: Incorporate real Catholic terminology, prayers (e.g., Our Mother of Perpetual Help novena), devotions
- [ ] Followup: Test responsiveness, verify links, add placeholder images, ensure no AI-generated feel

## Next Steps
1. Edit components/PriestWelcome.tsx to enhance the welcome message with more personal, authentic Catholic tone.
2. Create dynamic routing for association detail pages.
3. Populate remaining pages with detailed content.
